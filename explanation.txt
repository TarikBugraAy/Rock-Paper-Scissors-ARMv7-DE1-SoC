I will develop a  rock-paper-scissors game in ARMv7 DE1-SoC.
Ot should use a Seven Segment display to display scores and choosing of the machine and the user.
Users should use switches to decide on one of the rock-paper-scissors, and the machine chooses one
 of it randomly. Both should show up in the seven segment display. After that, according to the logic
  of the game, the winner should get 1 point. Points should also be shown in the seven segments.
   Users should be able to use switches to restart the game(erase scores and start again) or start
    the next round.

HEX0 --> Users Move
HEX1  --> Machine Move
HEX2-3  --> User score
HEX4-5  --> Machine Score

Switch 0 --> Rock 
Switch 1 --> Paper
Switch 2 --> Scissors
Switch 3 --> Start the round
Switch 4 --> Restart
