I am doing a rock paper-paper-scissors game in ARMv7 DE1-SoC.
 Game will be played against machine. User choses from rock-paper-scissors by switches.
  Then to start the round user pushes push button 0. When this happens to make machine
   choose from rock-paper-scissors.
    We take a value from timer and we use that value to randomly choose
     from rock-paper-scissors for machine.  After that score is incremented
      for machine or user or neither according to the logic of the rock-paper-scissors game.
       HEX0 shows users choice, HEX1 shows machines, HEX4 shows
       score of the user and HEX5 shows score of the machine.
        After the scores are updated if we push the pushbuttons
         1 we move on to the next round.
